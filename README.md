# chess-rs

`chess-rs` is a WIP program that interprets [Algebraic chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)). 

The goal is to be able to parse a list of moves and display the state of the board at the end. 

Eventually I want to make this into a TUI program to play chess with a peer over the Internet.
